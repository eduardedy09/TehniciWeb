WEBVTT - Some title

00:17.869 --> 00:19.974 align:left line:-1
I'm thinking so I with my mind

00:19.563 --> 00:21.863 align:left line:-1
Like when you visited Brasov you could have said

00:21.758 --> 00:23.758 align:left line:-1
Bathrooms what a nice thing it would be to live in such a city

00:23.725 --> 00:25.725 align:left line:-1
Yes, I had the same opinion and I

00:25.674 --> 00:27.814 align:left line:-1
And I said let's study a little bit the culture of the city, its history.

00:28.032 --> 00:30.032 align:left line:-1
Let's rub a little bit of people too

00:30.032 --> 00:32.137 align:left line:-1
Let's see how the people of Brasov smell, after all

00:32.342 --> 00:34.342 align:left line:-1
Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised

00:34.429 --> 00:36.429 align:left line:-1
But, not necessarily that it is a perfect city

00:36.540 --> 00:38.540 align:left line:-1
But rather that it suits my character

00:39.468 --> 00:44.213 align:left line:-1
That's as a little introduction and a little mess

00:44.820 --> 00:47.075 align:left line:-1
So, having these sentences said before

00:48.246 --> 00:53.166 align:left line:-1
Let's talk about 5 things that could bring you closer to Brasov or 5 things that at the same time

00:53.335 --> 00:57.110 align:left line:-1
You can say <i>*mna*</i>, it's not for me

00:57.200 --> 00:59.500 align:left line:-1
<i>one</i>

01:00.102 --> 01:02.182 align:left line:-1
It is a clean, safe and friendly city

01:02.400 --> 01:04.535 align:left line:-1
If you go to Brasov at midnight

01:04.794 --> 01:09.329 align:left line:-1
You are not afraid of clans, stray dogs, everywhere there is light and cleanliness.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.467 align:left line:-1
I talked to friends from Brasov, I talked to locals

01:11.512 --> 01:13.512 align:left line:-1
I searched and I all Brasov

01:13.562 --> 01:15.562 align:left line:-1
There are no bad neighborhoods

01:15.824 --> 01:18.644 align:left line:-1
I say friendly because not necessarily the world is friendly

01:18.710 --> 01:22.010 align:left line:-1
Because when you meet people on the street, of course they're friendly.

01:22.354 --> 01:24.954 align:left line:-1
I'm talking about the cases when you go to the counter, for example, to pay something

01:24.969 --> 01:30.659 align:left line:-1
Not infrequently I happen to meet with people who smiled friendly at me and explained to me if I was doing something wrong

01:31.000 --> 1:32.700 align:left line:-1
<i>two</i>

01:33.597 --> 01:35.702 align:left line:-1
In Brasov the traffic is <b>brilliant</b>!

01:35.910 --> 01:39.255 align:left line:-1
It's very fluid and, I pray, now it's going to appear kind and kind of carcotasi

01:39.152 --> 01:41.687 aalign:left line:-1
Who's going to say that this summer I don't know how it was and so on.

01:42.172 --> 01:44.172 align:left line:-1
Yes, in general, if there are no works

01:44.183 --> 01:46.963 align:left line:-1
or if there are no accidents or stuff like that

01:47.170 --> 01:49.170 align:left line:-1
There is nothing to go wrong traffic in Brasov

01:49.870 --> 01:51.870 align:left line:-1
It is, in my opinion, an example for the rest of the country

01:52.150 --> 01:54.420 align:left line:-1
What led to this streamlining of traffic?

01:54.733 --> 01:59.263 align:left line:-1
Well, roundabouts, few traffic lights, but well thought out

01:59.377 --> 02:01.377 align:left line:-1
And a lot of other stuff like that

02:01.00 --> 02:03.000 align:left line:-1
<i>three</i>

02:04.496 --> 02:07.046 align:left line:-1
In this city you have everything! Do you want to climb the mountain? Go up the mountain!

02:07.420 --> 02:09.905 align:left line:-1
Do you want to go to a club? Go to a club!

02:10.432 --> 02:14.432 align:left line:-1
Do you want to go to a restaurant a little more select? Go to a restaurant a little more select!

02:14.805 --> 02:17.565 align:left line:-1
It's a city for pretty much everyone, in terms of activities.

02:18.140 --> 02:19.430 align:left line:-1
You've got what it does!
